# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an automated CI/CD pipeline using *GitHub Actions* to build and deploy a simple website to *GitHub Pages* every time code is pushed to the main branch.


## Project Features

- Simple static website (index.html)
- Automated build and deployment using GitHub Actions workflow
- Deployment to GitHub Pages (no manual uploading needed)
- Continuous deployment triggered by Git pushes



## How It Works

1. You push code changes to the main branch.
2. GitHub Actions triggers the workflow defined in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.
3. The workflow checks out the code and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
4. The website updates automatically with the latest changes.
